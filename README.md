RayGame

RayGame is a  game development environment combining the BuLang scripting language and Raylib for graphics. Designed for rapid prototyping, it provides a straightforward syntax with the essential tools for game development, aimed at developers who love to write code and immediately see the results.
Why RayGame?

As a fan of C++, I’ve always appreciated its power but disliked the slow compilation times. I’ve experimented with various scripting languages, but often found the communication between script and C++ (and vice versa) complicated. With this in mind, I created BuLang, a scripting language specifically designed for games. RayGame integrates BuLang with C++, providing seamless interaction between script and C++, making it easy to write, test, and iterate.
Features

    Simple Syntax: BuLang is designed to be intuitive, borrowing familiar elements from languages like Python, JavaScript, and C++.
    Fast Prototyping: Quickly create and test game mechanics and logic with minimal setup.
    Raylib Integration: All of Raylib’s powerful 2D and 3D graphics functions are exposed to BuLang, making it easy to render, animate, and interact with game objects.
    Cross Communication: Easily call C++ functions from BuLang scripts and vice versa, removing the common barriers between scripting and compiled languages.
